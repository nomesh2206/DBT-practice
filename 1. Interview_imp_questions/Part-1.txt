1.)	Explain order of execution of SQL.
Order of execution of SQL:

1.	FROM: This clause selects the table(s) or view(s) from which to retrieve data.
2.	WHERE: This clause filters the rows based on a specified condition.
3.	GROUP BY: This clause groups the rows that have the same values into summary rows.
4.	HAVING: This clause filters groups based on a specified condition.
5.	SELECT: This clause selects the columns to include in the result set.
6.	DISTINCT: This keyword removes duplicates from the result set.
7.	ORDER BY: This clause sorts the result set by one or more columns.
8.	LIMIT / OFFSET: These clauses allow you to constrain the number of rows returned and skip a specified number of rows.
2.)	What is difference between where and having?
 	WHERE: Used to filter rows based on some condition.
 	HAVING: Used to filter groups after grouping. It is used along with aggregate functions.
3.)	What is the use of “group by”?
Used to group rows that have something common in particular, like we can group employees by department.
4.)	Explain all types of joins in SQL?
We have to work on multiple tables in RDBMS, so when we have to join two or more tables then we use JOINS. 
There are 5 types of joins:
 	INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
 	LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
 	RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
 	FULL JOIN: Returns records when there is a match in either left or right table.
 	SELF JOIN: When we have to join multiple columns of same table.
5.)	What are triggers in SQL?
Special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed or fired when a specific event occurs in a table (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
6.)	What is stored procedure in SQL
A prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
